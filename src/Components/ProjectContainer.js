                Redux and state management was incredibly important, as there were many moving parts in terms of components being constantly created, updated, and destroyed.
                For example, whenever a note was moved to a different location on the board, a thunk action would be dispatched, and the server would recieve the request to update the note's location.

                (invites, friend requests, messages, etc.) used long polling, which was slow and resource intensive.
